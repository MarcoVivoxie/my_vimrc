# my_vimrc

This is nothing more than a particular configuration.
But the complete configuration is from [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)

## My own configuration
I'm only adding the files in which I've edited / added some lines of configuration for my own purposes.

This modifications are basically some c / c++ flags for the [ale plugin](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) in order to check for syntax errors.

I also added the [monokai theme](https://github.com/sickill/vim-monokai).

The files that i modified (after _amix/vimrc_ installation, obviously) are:
- .vim_runtime/vimrcs/plugins_config.vim
- .vim_runtime/vimrcs/extended.vim

The monokai theme goes under .vim_runtime/my_plugins
